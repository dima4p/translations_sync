TranslatonsSync
===============

This plugin is intended to help the developer to synchronize the different locales for
the project that uses yaml based locales, in particular, I18n.


Requirements
============

gem 'ya2yaml'


Installation
============

1. As plugin
  rails plugin install http://github.com/dima4p/translatons_sync/

2. As gem
  sudo gem install translatons_sync
  translatons_sync


Description
===========

There are two rake tasks implemented in the plugin.

1. rake translatons:sync

This task generates the files with missing translations in the directory
config/locales. One file per a locale is created with the name missing_#{locale}.yml
Each file contains the text of one of the existing locales, namely the first one
existing. The order to check is defined by the LIST parameter. This parameter
can also be used to add a new locale.
The parameter EXCLUDE may be used to extract one or more locales from the participation
in the process. If any locale is mentioned in both lists, it will not participate in the
calculation of the missing translations but it's value may be used in the sample
translation.
The parameter NAME allows you to write the missing translations to the specified
files instead of default 'missing'.
The parameter SOURCE allows you to restrict the synchronization to be done within
only one file name. Only the files for all the locales that meet the given name
will be loaded for the synchronization.
The parameter IN sets both NAME and SOURCE to its value.

2. rake translatons:singles

This task generates a single file config/locales/singles.yml that contains the
translations occuring only in one locale.

3. rake translations:move KEY=key.to.move TO=where.to.move

This task moves the given KEY under the TO. Please note, that the TO
must not have the last part of the KEY at the end.
You can use all the parameters available for the translatons:sync task with the default
value for the NAME equal to 'moved'.
In order to overwrite the existing file both NAME and SOURCE should be given
with the same value. For that there is the parameter IN that sets both values.


So far it works only for rails applications. Suggestions for others are welcome.
